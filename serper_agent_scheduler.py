You have been given search results for the team: {team_name}.
Your job is to:
1. Parse these results to find **all upcoming matches** for {team_name}.
2. Identify the **chronologically closest future match**.
3. Extract details for **only that single next match**: opponent team, date/time (ISO8601 Brasilia), and viewing channels.
4. Format the result into a structured JSON containing **at most one match**.

## SEARCH RESULTS FOR {team_name}
```json
{json.dumps(search_result["data"], ensure_ascii=False)}
```

## EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT

The output should be a JSON object. The "matches" array should contain **zero or one** match object (only the very next future game).
```json
{{
  "matches": [
    {{
      "adversary": "<Opponent Team>",
      "datetime_brt": "<ISO8601 DateTime Brasilia TimeZone>",
      "channels": [
        {{"name": "<Channel Name>", "url": "<Channel URL>"}}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}
```

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Find all future matches first, then select ONLY the one happening soonest.
- If multiple games are on the same closest date, pick one arbitrarily.
- Ensure datetime_brt is in ISO8601 format with Brasilia timezone (-03:00).
- Remove any duplicate channels for the selected match.
- If no future matches are found, return an empty "matches" list: `{{"matches": []}}`.
- Only include the JSON object (starting with {{ and ending with }}) in your response, no additional text or explanations.

Please provide the structured JSON containing only the next future match for {team_name}:'''
